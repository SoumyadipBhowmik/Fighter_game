# GAME FEATURES

> I could've implemented more features into this game but I'm only a beginner and learning

<ul>
<li>5 in-game characters</li>
<li>2 players can play on the same screen</li>
<li>Individual sounds for individual characters</li>
<li>Background Sound and Countdown during start</li>
<li>Added an immovable but parallex background for an eye pleasing effect</li>
<li>Has a main menu but it's not that great. Neither does it have multiple features</li>
</ul>

# GETTING STARTED WITH THE GAME

<li>Open up your IDE. I prefer VS Code since it's lightweight but powerful</li>
<li>Make Sure you have python 3.10+ installed</li>
<li>Clone the forked repository</li>
<li>Run it. Play it. Enjoy it.</li>
<li>If you like this game, Star this repository so I can get more motivation to create what I've started</li>
